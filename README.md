# **Food Order App**

A modern and responsive food ordering application built with **React**. This app allows users to browse a menu, place orders, and interact with real-time data. It demonstrates key concepts of React such as state management, side effects, and integration with external services and databases.

## **1. Features**

- **Global State Management with Context API**  
  Utilizes React's Context API to manage global application state efficiently, avoiding prop drilling across deeply nested components.

- **Component State with `useState`**  
  Implements the `useState` hook for managing local UI state in functional components.

- **Side Effects with `useEffect`**  
  Uses the `useEffect` hook to handle side effects such as data fetching, event listeners, or local storage interactions.

- **HTTP Requests Integration**  
  Interacts with external APIs using HTTP requests to fetch dynamic content like menu items, pricing, or availability.

- **Database Connectivity**  
  Connects to a backend database to store and retrieve persistent data such as user orders, cart items, and order history.
